A small mod that adds a Keybind for dedicated Offhand use (by default Mouse 4) and a bindable Keybind for dedicated Mainhand use.
By default MCs handling for the Use(right-click) keybind is:
- check for block interaction (buttons and co)
- check for Mainhand interaction (check selected slot for interaction)
- check for Offhand interaction
    
if an interaction is found the others are not checked. This Mods adds 2 more Keybinds into the game, allowing for eclusive
- check for Mainhand interaction (check selected slot for interaction)
    
and an exclusive
- check for Offhand interaction

this allows you for example to block while holding a trident or to not place offhand torches while building when using the dedicated keybinds


### Im unsure if anticheats might not be happy about players beeing able to block while holding a bow/trident or similar. Use at own risk.
It does **NOT** allow you to execute two interactions at the same time! It just allows you to have more control over which interaction to use.
